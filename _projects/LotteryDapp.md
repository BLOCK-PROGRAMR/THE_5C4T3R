# LotteryDapp â€” Secure, Fair Blockchain Lottery

## Overview
**LotteryDapp** is a blockchain-based lottery where players join by paying an entry fee.  
At set intervals, a random winner is picked using **Chainlink VRF**, ensuring results are provably fair.  
No central authority controls the draw or payouts â€” all logic runs in a public smart contract.

---

## Key Features
- **Provably Fair Randomness** â€” Winner selected via Chainlink VRF.
- **Automated Draws** â€” Supports Chainlink Keepers or manual triggers.
- **Simple Entry** â€” Call `enter()` with the entry fee to join.
- **Full Pot Payout** â€” Winner receives the collected funds.
- **Event Tracking** â€” Emits events for entries, draws, and payouts.
- **Live Frontend** â€” React.js UI showing pot size, players, and past winners.

---

## Security Highlights
- **Randomness Integrity** â€” No block-based randomness; VRF prevents prediction or manipulation.
- **Safe Payouts** â€” Uses Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern with optional pull payments.
- **Access Control** â€” Only authorized admin can change key settings; ownership can be renounced.
- **Gas Safety** â€” No unbounded loops; player limit keeps transactions efficient.
- **Recovery Mode** â€” Handles oracle failure with refund or manual draw options.

---

## Limitations
- **Sybil Risk** â€” One address = one entry, but users can create multiple addresses.
- **Oracle Dependency** â€” Requires Chainlink VRF for randomness; fallback needed if unavailable.

---

## Tech Stack
- Solidity â€” Core lottery logic.
- Hardhat â€” Development & testing.
- Ethers.js â€” Blockchain interaction.
- React.js â€” Frontend UI.
- Chainlink VRF + Keepers â€” Randomness & automation.
