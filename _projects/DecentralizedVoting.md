# Voting Application â€” On-Chain Secure Election

## Overview
The **Voting Application** is a blockchain-based election system that records every vote directly on Ethereum.  
It supports two fixed candidates â€” **YCP** and **TDP** â€” and ensures results cannot be altered after deployment.  
Users connect with **MetaMask** to vote, and results are viewable in real time.

---

## Key Features
- **Immutable Candidates** â€” Candidate list is set at deployment and cannot be changed.
- **One Vote per Address** â€” Smart contract blocks double voting using a voter tracking mapping.
- **Transparent Results** â€” Anyone can view vote counts on-chain without a middleman.
- **No Admin Control** â€” No reset, override, or privileged vote functions exist.
- **MetaMask + React Frontend** â€” Simple UI for voting and viewing live tallies.

---

## Security Highlights
- **Vote Integrity** â€” All votes are permanent and public on-chain records.
- **Double-Vote Prevention** â€” Once an address votes, further attempts revert.
- **Admin Abuse Prevention** â€” Contract ownership is renounced after deployment.
- **DoS Resistance** â€” No heavy loops in voting or tallying; all reads are O(1).

---

## Limitations
- **Sybil Attacks** â€” One address = one vote, but multiple addresses can be created without identity checks.
- **Public Votes** â€” No privacy; votes are linked to Ethereum addresses.

---

## Tech Stack
- Solidity â€” Voting logic.
- Hardhat â€” Development & testing.
- Ethers.js â€” Blockchain interaction.
- React.js + Tailwind CSS â€” Frontend display.
- MetaMask â€” Authentication & signing.
