# Fund Me â€” ETH Crowdfunding with Price Feeds

## Overview
**Fund Me** is a Solidity-based smart contract that accepts ETH contributions and calculates their USD value in real time using a **Chainlink ETH/USD price feed**.  
It is built and deployed using **Foundry** â€” a fast, modular Ethereum development toolkit written in Rust.

---

## Key Features
- **Fund Contract** â€” Users send ETH via the `fund()` function.
- **USD Conversion** â€” Real-time price data from Chainlink oracles.
- **Owner Withdraw** â€” Only the contract owner can withdraw collected funds.
- **Minimum Funding Requirement** â€” Enforces a minimum USD amount before accepting contributions.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** â€” Smart contract logic.
- **Foundry** â€” Development, testing, and deployment.
- **Chainlink Price Feeds** â€” ETH/USD conversion.
- **Sepolia Testnet** â€” Deployment and testing network.

---

## Security Highlights
- **Access Control** â€” Only the owner can withdraw funds.
- **Price Feed Validation** â€” Reliable Chainlink oracle data.
- **Gas Efficiency** â€” Optimized contract structure.
- **Test Coverage** â€” Unit tests for funding, withdrawal, and price conversion logic.

## Typical Workflow
1. **Fund** â€” User calls `fund()` with ETH.
2. **Price Check** â€” Contract checks USD value using Chainlink.
3. **Store Contribution** â€” Records sender and amount.
4. **Withdraw** â€” Owner retrieves total funds.
