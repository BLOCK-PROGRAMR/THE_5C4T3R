**Emotion NFT** is an on-chain NFT project where users can mint tokens based on their current mood or emotion.  
Each NFTâ€™s metadata and traits are generated dynamically, ensuring uniqueness and tamper-proof storage.  
The project is built with **Solidity** for the smart contract, tested using **Foundry**, and deployed via **Anvil**.
