# OptimusNFT â€” Secure ERC-721 Deployment

## Overview
**OptimusNFT** is a custom **ERC-721** NFT contract built with **Foundry** and deployed on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.  
It integrates with **OpenSea** for marketplace compatibility and focuses on **security-first design** â€” preventing common NFT vulnerabilities through strict access controls, immutable metadata, and safe minting logic.

---

## Key Features
- **ERC-721 + ERC-2981** â€” NFT standard with royalty support.
- **Safe Public Minting** â€” Supply cap and price validation.
- **Marketplace Ready** â€” IPFS-hosted metadata for decentralization.
- **Immutable Metadata** â€” Prevents post-deployment tampering.

---

## Security Highlights
- **Reentrancy Prevention** â€” CEI pattern + `nonReentrant`.
- **Strict Access Control** â€” `Ownable` for admin functions.
- **No Unbounded Loops** â€” Avoids gas DoS risks.
- **Metadata Protection** â€” Immutable base URI after deployment.

---

## Tech Stack
- Solidity â€” Smart contract logic.
- Foundry â€” Development & testing.
- Ethereum (Goerli) â€” Deployment network.
- IPFS â€” Metadata storage.
